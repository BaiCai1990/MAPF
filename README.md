# Introduction
An implementation of Multi-agent pathfinding using
A* with Operator Decomposition (OD)

##Completed
* naive A* algorithm that stores all nodes expanded. Implement iterative
deepening A* for lower space complexity.
* Path backtrace from goal to root enabled for n agents
* Multiple agent path finding with simple collision detection

##Todo
* Multi-agent swap collisions
* Smarter checking of post-move collision
* Prune branches (disallow reverse move)
